<h1>Oberheim Matrix-1000 single patch editor</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This software allows to open/edit/save single patches for Oberheim
Matrix-1000 synthesizer. </p>
<p>Since users generally own a MIDI sequencer, the editor don't have MIDI thru function.<br>
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>MacOSX 10.4,10.3, should also work on 10.2.<br>
A Oberheim Matrix-1000.<br>
A MIDI interface.<br>
A Mac PPC or Intel.
</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>
First you have to configure your Matrix MIDI input and output port in
preferences panel. No channel number is necessary because the software
don't have MIDI thru. </p>
<p>If your Matrix is like mine (with bugs), you have to set Send patch for ENV1 SUSTAIN and Send Patch for ENV2 TO VCA2 because
when I send the parameter using the same SYSEX as for the other parameters, ENV1 SUSTAIN doesn't work and ENV2 TO VCA2 crashes the Matrix.
So when the checkboxes are on, I send the whole patch for these parameters.
</p>
<p>
Then you can get a patch from the synth with Patch-&gt;Get menu or get
the edit buffer. </p>
<p>When you open a patch from disk, default is to not transmit it to the synth,
you have to do it with Patch-&gt;Send. It allows to get the current
edit buffer if something interesting have to be saved first. 
You can change this behavior in the Preferences panel.
</p>
<p>
Global parameters are not saved with the patch, perhaps I'll do it in
the future. Since Matrix-1000 don't allow single global parameter edit,
you have to get/send the whole
parameters.<br>
</p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
